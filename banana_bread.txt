I'm not generally someone who spends hours at one website, and I'm not a poster on any other sites.  But this site has me hooked. I've only been a member here for a few weeks, but I have learned so much and enjoy searching this site for all it has to offer.  The answers and support here are just great.  Thank You to all who make it so interesting.

I'd like to offer my family's favorite banana bread recipe.  It is incredibly easy to make, has no eggs, and is very flexible.  I tend to bake by feel and sight.  (I measure baking soda in my hand- shades of my Grandmother) and this bread always comes out.  It is pretty dense, sweet and very moist.

1/2 cup shortening or canola oil, or butter etc. (I sometimes leavemost of it out and use 1/3c applesauce)
1 cup white sugar (you can cut this back too- I often use a scant 3/4 cup)
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour ( have mixed this with WW, white WW and spelt with good results)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3 very ripe mashed bananas (I use all different sizes and amounts- about 1 1/2c)
1-2 teaspoons pure vanilla
chocolate chips

 
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan. (This can be made in any size pan or muffin tins just adjust the baking time)
In a large bowl, cream the shortening and sugar and add vanilla. Sift in the flour, baking soda and salt. Blend in the mashed bananas. Stir in the chocplate chips. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until it tests done with a toothpick.
When I make this in the Kitchen Aid, I just spin the bananas in the bowl with the paddle to mash them, then continue with the recipe. Only one bowl to wash!

 I seem to make some form of banana bread every week this one is requested most often.  It's adapted from one here: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Banana-Bread-VIII/Detail.aspx
